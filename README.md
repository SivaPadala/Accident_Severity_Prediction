<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Road traffic accidents have always been a serious issue in modern society. According to statistical results, more than 90% of accidents have been caused by a driver’s mistake and/or fatigue. Such accidents result in loss of life and material. These are caused by the carelessness of drivers and their ignorance and negligence of traffic rules.
Approximately 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes.

Some of the reasons for Road Accidents:
* Over Speeding.
* Drunken Driving.
* Distractions to Driver.
* Red Light Jumping.
* Avoiding Safety Gears like Seat belts and Helmets.
* Non-adherence to lane driving and overtaking in a wrong manner.

**Road accidents are one of the most relevant causes of injuries and death worldwide, and therefore, they constitute a significant field of research on the use of advanced algorithms and techniques to analyze and predict traffic accidents and determine the most relevant elements that contribute to road accidents.**

### Advanced-algorithms
Machine Learning is the ability to train machines for the required model out put using the algorithms which function on the mathematical and statistical background.Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves and automates the process. Some of the important Machine Learning Algorithms.

### Beneficiaries
This project is mainly useful for people who travel by cars and other means of transport. It explains about weather and road conditions which indicates the probability of getting into accidents. So the normal people and also the Government can use this project to reduce road accidents.


<!-- DESCRIPTION OF DATA -->
## Description of Data

The data is collected from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedlahlou/accidents-in-france-from-2005-to-2016) which contains dataset of 'Accidents in France from 2005 to 2016'. It has a total of 839986 rows which contain information about Accident details in clear format and its charecteristics. The kaggle datasets contain an extended descriptions of different aspect of the accidents, thus I've selected the most relevant and useful data for my analysis.

### Attribute Selection

The capstone project consists of [Notebook File]() which consists of information about the data attributes which are taken into consideration and the ones which are dropped from the data as they are of no use. It contains all the steps and transformations I made to the data which include data cleansing, removal of duplicate values and unwanted data. 
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
