<h2 align="center"><u>Car Accident Severity</u></h2>


Road traffic accidents have always been a serious issue in modern society. According to statistical results, more than 90% of accidents have been caused by a driverâ€™s mistake and/or fatigue. Such accidents result in loss of life and material. These are caused by the carelessness of drivers and their ignorance and negligence of traffic rules.
Approximately 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes.
The2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has set an ambitious target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2020.
Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.
More than half of all road traffic deaths are among vulnerable road users: pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.
